This repo contains the solutions to three exercises I did as part of my C++ intro course in university. Each folder contains the solutions for: 

* A sudoku solver; 
* An Enigma machine emulator which can encode and decode text provided in files or standard input;
* A simple chess program which can read moves, check if they are valid, and decide when a chess game has ended in a mate or stalemate. 

Some of the code in the *sudoku* exercises is not my own, but was provided by my instructors (Computing department in Imperial College London) -- this is clearly marked in the .cpp and .h files. The pdf specifications for the *enigma* and *chess* exercises were also provided by my instructors.
